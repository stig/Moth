Moth -- my/mini othello
=======================

Moth is an Othello game with a console and OpenGL frontend. It is
written as a `proof of concept' for GGTL, the Generic Game-Tree
Library. It is fairly simplistic, -- but some of the features
include:

 o unlimited undo
 o save to file / resume from file
 o different modes of play: 
   - human vs human
   - human vs computer
   - computer vs computer 
 o various difficulty levels

The AI player is provided by GGTL. It use an Alpha-Beta algorithm
with iterative deepening and naive move ordering (based on the
previous searches).

Difficult-levels can be specified on the commandline -- 0 to N,
where N is the number of seconds you want to allow the game to
search for each move. N is only limited by how long you care to
wait for the AI to move, and how much memory your machine has ;)

moth 3 3	# both players get 3 seconds to find a move
moth 3 5	# player 1 get 3 seconds; player 2 get 5 seconds
moth 5		# equivalent to `moth 5 3' since 1 is default 

You can play either (or both) players, and you can change which
one you want to play as you go. Just hit enter will make the AI
pick a move as best as it can; put in coordinates and you pick a
move.
