moth -- my/mini othello
=======================

`moth' is a small othello game written as a `proof of concept' around
GGTL, the General Game-Tree Library. It really is fairly simple -- but
still it supports unlimited undo, save to file / resume from file, human
vs human, human vs computer and computer vs computer play. 

The `AI' is nothing fancy, simply a straight minimax-search with
alpha-beta pruning, as provided out-of-the-box by GGTL. It's fairly
effective though.

Difficult-levels can be specified on the commandline -- 0 to N, where N
is a positive integer. N is only limited by how long you can be arsed to
wait for it to move (and how much memory you have ;) ).
                                                                                                                               
moth 3 3      # makes both players search to 3 ply (this is the default)
moth 3 5      # makes player one search to 3 ply and player two to 5 ply 
moth 5        # equivalent to `moth 5 3' since 3 is default setting

You can play either (or both) players, and you can change which one you 
want to play as you go. Just hit enter will make moth pick a move as 
best as it can, put in coordinates and you pick a move.
