moth -- my/mini othello
=======================

`moth' is a small othello game written as a `proof of concept' around
GGTL, the General Game-Tree Library. It really is fairly simple -- but
still it supports unlimited undo, save to file / resume from file, human
vs human, human vs computer and computer vs computer play. 

The `AI' is nothing fancy, simply a straight minimax-search with
alpha-beta pruning, as provided out-of-the-box by GGTL. It's fairly
effective though.
