Moth -- my/mini othello
=======================

Moth is an Othello game with a console and OpenGL frontend. It is
written as a `proof of concept' for GGTL, the Generic Game-Tree
Library. It is fairly simplistic, -- but some of the features
include:

 o unlimited undo
 o save to file / resume from file
 o different modes of play: 
   - human vs human
   - human vs computer
   - computer vs computer 
 o various difficulty levels

The AI player is provided by GGTL. It use an Alpha-Beta algorithm
with iterative deepening and naive move ordering (based on the
previous searches).

Difficult-levels can be specified on the commandline -- 0 to N,
where N is a positive integer. N is only limited by how long you
care to wait for the AI to move (and how much memory your machine
has ;) ).
                                                                                                                               
moth 30 30    # both players get 30/100 seconds to find a move
moth 30 50    # player 1 get 30/100 seconds; player 2 get 1/2 second
moth 50       # equivalent to `moth 50 30' since 30 is default setting

You can play either (or both) players, and you can change which
one you want to play as you go. Just hit enter will make the AI
pick a move as best as it can; put in coordinates and you pick a
move.
