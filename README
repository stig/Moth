Moth -- my/mini othello
=======================

Moth is an Othello game with a console and OpenGL frontend. It is
written as a `proof of concept' for GGTL, the Generic Game-Tree
Library. It is fairly simplistic, -- but some of the features
include:

 o unlimited undo
 o save to file / resume from file
 o different modes of play: 
   - human vs human
   - human vs computer
   - computer vs computer 
 o various difficulty levels

The AI player is provided by GGTL. It uses an Alpha-Beta
algorithm with iterative deepening (the default, but fixed-depth
search is available too).

You can play either (or both) players, and you can change which
one you want to play as you go. Just hit enter will make the AI
pick a move as best as it can; put in coordinates and you pick a
move.
