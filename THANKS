This is where I show my gratitude ;}

First, I'd like to offer a big "THANK YOU" to my supervisor,
Dimitris Parapadakis <parapadd@wmin.ac.uk>, who helped me keep
this project on the right track.

Parts of the code (particularly the functions valid_move() and
make_move(), and the heuristic used for evaluation) is inspired
by code from GNOME Iagno by Ian Peters <ipeters@acm.org>.
