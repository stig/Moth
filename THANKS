This game was first written as a proof-of-concept for the first
version of GGTL.

First, I'd like to offer a big "THANK YOU" to my supervisor,
Dimitris Parapadakis <parapadd@wmin.ac.uk>, who helped me keep
this project on the right track.

Thanks to Matthias Rustler for reporting a bug in the option
parsing code.
